# PyQIR compatible systems

## Operating systems

PyQIR runs on most x86-64 operating systems that can run Python 3.6+; however,
not all of these systems are equally compatible. Operating systems are grouped
into tiers that represent the level of compatibility users can expect.

- Tier 1 systems are compatible. For tier 1 systems:
  - operating system is used in automated tests
  - installation packages provided for them
- Tier 2 systems should be compatible with PyQIR and can be used relatively
  easily. For tier 2 systems:
  - informal testing may have been done
  - the packages for tier 1 systems will likely work in tier 2 systems
