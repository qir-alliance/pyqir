"""
Provides the ability to generate QIR using a Python API.

This package is intended to be used by code automating translation processes
enabling the conversion in some format to QIR via Python; i.e., this is a low
level API intended to be used as a bridge to existing Python frameworks enabling
the generation of QIR rather than directly consumed by an end-user. It is not
intended to be used as a framework for algorithm and application development.
