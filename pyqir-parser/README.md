# pyqir-parser

The pyqir-parser provides utilities for parsing QIR from bitcode files into convenience objects in Python.
It includes mechanisms for walking the functions and blocks in a given QIR program, with additional support for
QIR-specific conventions like getting static qubit identifiers or measurement result identifiers. It is not designed
for output of QIR, and does not provide any functionality for modifying or transforming the parsed QIR.
